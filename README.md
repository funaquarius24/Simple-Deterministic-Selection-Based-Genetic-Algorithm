# Simple-Deterministic-Selection-Based-Genetic-Algorithm
The original code for  Simple Deterministic Selection-Based Genetic Algorithm for Hyperparameter Tuning of Machine Learning Models

The code was hosted on Google Drive and ran on Google Colab. 
For a successful run, the folder structure should be as follows:

scripts: /Colab Notebooks/scripts/
Datasets: /Colab Notebooks/Datasets/

All other folders can be anywhere but it is better to put them under /Colab Notebooks/

The BenchmarkExperiments folder was run locally but it can also be run on Colab. 
The final code for the benchmarks is the **TestCompareHighPop.ipynb** so Jupyer is needed to run it.
Other codes in the folder can be run but the results presented in the paper were gotten through the Jupyter code.
